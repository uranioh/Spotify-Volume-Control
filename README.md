# Spotify-Volume-Control
Work in progress project of an application able to change Spotify's volume with a shortcut while playing games or anything else.

TO-DO:
- Everything else
- Testing the application because apparently it cannot fucking work without a premium subscription
- 2nd commit:
  - Implementing the RefreshCode functionality to avoid logging in every single time the app gets launcher
  - Still, everything else, but now I can get the now playing artist
  - Lyrics overlay

DONE:
- Resume playback method (u n t e s t e d)
- Fully working login flow via AuthorizationCode (!)

NEED:
- Mental help

Feel free to commit whatever
